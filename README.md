# Hangman_game
WHAT HANGMAN DOES:
► Our code will generate a word which has to be guessed by the player. So, at the 
output screen will exist marked out blanks (short lines) for each letter of a word. 
► Then the player will guess a letter. If that letter is in the word(s) then the program 
will write the letter at everyplace it appears, and cross out that letter in the 
alphabet. If the letter isn't in the word, then we cross out the lifelines (which are 
usually a finite no. of chances) from the list. 
► The player will continue guessing the letters until he can either solve the word (or 
phrase) or he will end up losing all the lifelines and he will be declared a LOSER
